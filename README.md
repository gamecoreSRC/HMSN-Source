# HMSN-Source
A long time ago (a couple months ago), I had made a game that was a PC port of a ripoff called "Hello Minion
Spooky Neigbor" and published it on GameJolt. It's just an AssetRipper decompile and script rewrite.

Because I'm bored, here's the source to that exact game (built on Unity 2018.4.4f1)

(and because i have no idea what im doing, the source is in the releases)

I'm pretty sure it's fine to keep this up since somebody already decompiled the commercial (PC) version of
Granny and that's been on GitHub for like 2 years.
