# HMSN-Source
A long time ago (a couple months ago), I had made a game that was a PC port of a ripoff called "Hello Minion
Spooky Neigbor" and published it on GameJolt. It's literally just an AssetRipper decompile and script rewrite.

Because I'm bored, here's the source to that exact game (built on Unity 2018.4.4f1)

(and because i have no idea what im doing, the source is in the releases)
